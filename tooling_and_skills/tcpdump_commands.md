## What is TCPDump?

TCPDump is a command-line tool used to capture traffic on the network and analyze captured packets of data passing through your machine.

Similar to Wireshark, but without the GUI and useful when automation is required.

#### Capture Commands

Use the following commands to capture data.

| COMMAND          | EXAMPLE USAGE                    | EXPLANATION                                                  |

#### Filter Commands

You can add special filter expressions to the tcpdump keyword to pick out specific packets. They’re especially helpful when you want to analyze saved packet capture files. Each filter expression is a single- or multi-word parameter and its argument, separated by spaces. You may also apply logical operators to combine two filter expressions.
