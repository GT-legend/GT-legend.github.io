## Security Concepts          

### 1.1 Explain common threats against on-premises, hybrid, and cloud environments 

1.1.a On-premises: viruses, trojans, DoS/DDoS attacks, phishing, rootkits, man-in-the middle attacks, SQL injection, cross-site scripting, malware 

1.1.b Cloud: data breaches, insecure APIs, DoS/DDoS, compromised credentials 

### 1.2 Compare common security vulnerabilities such as software bugs, weak and/or hardcoded passwords, OWASP top ten, missing encryption ciphers, buffer overflow, path traversal, cross-site scripting/forgery 

### 1.3 Describe functions of the cryptography components such as hashing, encryption, PKI, SSL, IPsec, NAT-T IPv4 for IPsec, preshared key, and certificate-based authorization 

### 1.4 Compare site-to-site and remote access VPN deployment types and components such as virtual tunnel interfaces, standards-based IPsec, DMVPN, FlexVPN, and Cisco Secure Client including high availability considerations 

### 1.5 Describe security intelligence authoring, sharing, and consumption 

### 1.6 Describe the controls used to protect against phishing and social engineering attacks 

### 1.7 Explain North Bound and South Bound APIs in the SDN architecture 

### 1.8 Explain Cisco DNA Center APIs for network provisioning, optimization, monitoring, and troubleshooting

### 1.9 Interpret basic Python scripts used to call Cisco Security appliances APIs 

## Network Security

### 2.1 Compare network security solutions that provide intrusion prevention and firewall 
capabilities 

### 2.2 Describe deployment models of network security solutions and architectures that provide intrusion prevention and firewall capabilities 

### 2.3 Describe the components, capabilities, and benefits of NetFlow and Flexible NetFlow 
records 

### 2.4 Configure and verify network infrastructure security methods 

2.4.a Layer 2 methods (network segmentation using VLANs; Layer 2 and port security; DHCP snooping; Dynamic ARP inspection; storm control; PVLANs to segregate network traffic; and defenses against MAC, ARP, VLAN hopping, STP, and DHCP rogue attacks) 

2.4.b Device hardening of network infrastructure security devices (control plane, data plane, and management plane) 

### 2.5 Implement segmentation, access control policies, AVC, URL filtering, malware protection, and intrusion policies 

### 2.6 Implement management options for network security solutions (single vs. multidevice manager, in-band vs. out-of-band, cloud vs. on-premises) 

### 2.7 Configure AAA for device and network access such as TACACS+ and RADIUS 

### 2.8 Configure secure network management of perimeter security and infrastructure devices such as SNMPv3, NetConf, RestConf, APIs, secure syslog, and NTP with authentication 

### 2.9 Configure and verify site-to-site and remote access VPN 

2.9.a Site-to-site VPN using Cisco routers and IOS 

2.9.b Remote access VPN using Cisco AnyConnect Secure Mobility client 

2.9.c Debug commands to view IPsec tunnel establishment and troubleshooting
